fitting - the algorithm for fitting pieces in a section
images - images of the game in the swamp area
solver - solver of the game in the swamp area(rotation and blue sqrs not yet supported)
solver_v2 - solver with the addition of broken edges
generator-v1 - generates puzzles using threads
generator-v2 - generates puzzles using threads and a shared queue
path_generator - given a set of paths S, it tries to create puzzles where S is a solution set
sim_generator - generates a set of simultaneous puzzles
name_paths - generates a DFS tree for all the paths, this way we can have an id for each path
sequence_sum - generates all multisets that sum to n
